      "*   **Algorithms:**  These are sets of rules or instructions that tell the AI how to process the data.\n",
      "*   **Learning:** Through algorithms, AI identifies patterns, makes predictions, and learns from its mistakes, improving its performance over time. There are several types of learning, including:\n",
      "    *   **Supervised Learning:** AI is trained on labeled data (data with correct answers).\n",
      "    *   **Unsupervised Learning:** AI finds patterns in unlabeled data.\n",
      "    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** AI learns through trial and error, receiving rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect ones.\n",
